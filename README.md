# Exploratory Analysis on Synthesised Transaction Data at a Bank

Here we predict the annual salary of 100 customers using a dataset synthesized by ANZ Bank (available on theforage.com) containing 12043 transactions made by the customers between August and October 2018. The analysis uses numpy and pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly for data visualisation and Scikit-Learn for building regression models.
