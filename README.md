# Predicting Salary of Bank Customers Based on Transactions

Here we predict the annual salary of 100 customers based on a dataset synthesized by ANZ Bank (available on theforage.com) containing 12043 transactions between August and October 2018. The analysis was performed in Python using numpy and pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly for data visualisation and Scikit-Learn for building regression models.
